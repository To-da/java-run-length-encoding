# Answer 1: decode failure

`Decode` followed by `Encode` does not produce the original stream of integers when the input stream cannot
be decoded. For example

```
< 0 >

```
decodes to the following stream (where `^` denotes error termination):
```
< ^

```
which, in turn, encodes to the following stream:
```
< ^

```
which is not the same as the original stream.

This answer is probably the most obvious. Can you think of other answers?
