# Answer 4: encode aborted by error

This is a nasty side-effect of the implementation of `Encode`. `Decode` followed by `Encode`
does not produce the original stream of integers when `Encode` is aborted by an error from `Decode`.
For example (where `^` denotes error termination):

```
< 2, 1, ^

```
decodes to the following stream:
```
< 1, 1 ^

```
which, perhaps surprisingly, encodes to:
```
< ^

```
which is not the same as the original stream.

This is tested by `testEncodeAbortedByError` in
[DecodeEncodeRoundTripTests.java](../tests/src/test/java/integration/DecodeEncodeRoundTripTests.java).
