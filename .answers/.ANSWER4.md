# Answer 4

This is a nasty side-effect of the implementation of `Encode`. `Decode` followed by `Encode`
does not produce the original stream of integers when `Encode` is aborted by an error from `Decode`. For example:

```
< 2, 1, 0 >

```
decodes to the following stream ((where `^` denotes error termination)):
```
< 1, 1 ^

```
which, perhaps surprisingly, encodes to:
```
< ^

```
which is not the same as the original stream.
