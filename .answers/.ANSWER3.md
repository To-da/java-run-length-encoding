# Answer 3

Similar to answer 2, `Decode` followed by `Encode` does not produce the original stream of integers
when the input stream contains two or more consecutive runs for the same value. For example

```
< 1, 1, 1, 1 >

```
decodes to:
```
< 1, 1 >

```
which encodes to:
```
< 2, 1 >

```
which is not the same as the original stream.
